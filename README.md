# pTSL

This repository contains code used in

Mayer, C. (to appear). Capturing gradience in long-distance phonotactics using probabilistic tier-based strictly local grammars. *Proceedings of the Society for Computation in Linguistics.*

The code that's in here right now is hacky and disorganized, but you'll soon see a nice general command-line interface that will allow you to calculate probabilities given a pTSL grammar, and learn probabilities from data. Stay tuned!
